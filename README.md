Experience
----------

#### Research Assistant at the LSE (2014-2015)

-   I took qualitative data collected by a post-doc and regularized
    certain fields to make it ready for statistical analysis. I managed
    to do the bulk of this with a few scripts and the long tail with
    individual find/replaces.
-   I wrote a script to scrape drug reviews off of forums relating the
    the Silk Road and Agora, with some rudimentary text analysis to
    extract drug names, prices, and names of some prolific dealers.
