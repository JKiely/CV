## Experience

### Research Assistant(2014-2015)
- Using Stata, Excel, and just a little R to clean data for some papers looking at the relationship between income and voter turnout.
- Writing python code to scrape drug reviews and prices off of forums relating the the silk road and agora, as well as advising on code to scrape the sites themselves. Yes, this really was for a grad student and not for myself.

### Barman/Manager (2008-2010, 2011-2012)
- Nothing to do with coding, but I was involved with scheduling, in charge of training (and sometimes hiring) new staff, and a key holder for the building and the safe.


## Education

### London School of Economics (2012-2016)
- BSc Socology (Hons)
- ASIEC Society (2012-2013): I wound up teaching English in the Shandong province of China during the summer of 2013.
- Debate Society (2012-2013): I broke (made it to the final round) in two tournaments, but I generally kinda sucked at it.
- LSE Groups (2014): An internal event in which teams have to prepare an academic paper with original research in two weeks and present it at a conference on the final day. We placed second.

### Makers Academy
