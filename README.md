## Skills

### Python
The first language I learnt and the one I've spent the most time with over the past few years. I started with Edx's 6.00.1x and I've since used it to try web development, data exploration, command line apps, and several non-python specific moocs.
#### Examples:
##### Noughts and Crosses
- https://github.com/JKiely/noughts-crosses
- A command line tic-tac-toe game created using Python, and tested using Pytest.

##### Spell-checker
- https://github.com/JKiely/spell-checker
- Started out life as a me procrastinating after reading a Peter Norvig post but is in the process of growing into an online spell-checker using flask (a WIP).
- It uses /[uni|bi|tri]gram/ frequencies from a given corpus, and Damerau–Levenshtein distance to suggest corrections to words it doesn't recognize.

### Web Development
I studied web development for 12 weeks at the Makers Academy bootcamp. In that time I became comfortable with Rails, and familiar with Node. But since I have spent most of my time with Flask.
#### Examples
##### Totes-random
- https://github.com/JKiely/Totes-Random
- I worked with two other people, most of my time went into the back end, but we paired on all parts.
- A 'satirical random number generator' which uses the entropy of people telling twitter how random they are to seed a Mersenne twister.
