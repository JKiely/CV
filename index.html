<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p>The first language I learnt and the one I've spent the most time with over the past few years. I started with Edx's 6.00.1x and I've since used it to try web development, data exploration, command line apps, and several non-python specific moocs.</p>
<h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4>
<h5 id="noughts-and-crosses">Noughts and Crosses</h5>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/JKiely/noughts-crosses</li>
<li>A command line tic-tac-toe game created using Python, and tested using Pytest.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="spell-checker">Spell-checker</h5>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/JKiely/spell-checker</li>
<li>Started out life as a me procrastinating after reading a Peter Norvig post but is in the process of growing into an online spell-checker using flask (a WIP).</li>
<li>It uses /[uni|bi|tri]gram/ frequencies from a given corpus, and Damerau–Levenshtein distance to suggest corrections to words it doesn't recognize.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="web-development">Web Development</h3>
<p>I studied web development for 12 weeks at the Makers Academy bootcamp. In that time I became comfortable with Rails, and familiar with Node. But since I have spent most of my time with Flask.</p>
